# Customer Classification (Loan Data) on the basis of Cluster data by using cross validation and Ensemble Learning

The basis of the project is to classify the customer data on the basis of cluster data that the bank can take on the basis of loan data. This will allow the institutional bank to customize services and products for the segment.

In this project, cross validation and ensemble learning methods were used and are compared with each other to know which model is the best that can be taken by the bank.
